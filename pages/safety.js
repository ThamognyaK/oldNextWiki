          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This project has a biosafety level of 2. To
          manage the amount of risk in this project, a strict set of rules were
          followed and written procedures were planned and approved by the
          Chulalongkorn lab advisors to ensure proper biosafety. Proper training
          on decontamination, biological waste management, personal protective
          equipment, safe handling of biological spills, and the transportation
          of biological materials were received from the Chulalongkorn lab
          advisors. This allowed the team to upload lab rules to a high
          standard. Additionally, the team was provided with the proper personal
          protective equipment, biosafety supplies, and training for this
          project. <sup>[1-7]</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, when working with{" "}
          <i>A. tumefaciens</i>, a biosafety cabinet was used to prevent the
          potential effects of inhalation or skin contact. When agroinfiltrating{" "}
          <i>N. benthamiana</i>, safety glasses and lab coats were used to
          prevent the <i>A. tumefaciens</i> from entering the eyes.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thailand-RIS team members did not take any
          substances outside of the lab and did not bring any inside (i.e.
          food). The lab used is one that is used by many other Chulalongkorn
          biologists who, alongside the Thailand-RIS team, adhere to strict
          regulations<sup>[1-7]</sup> to remain safe for biosafety level 2
          experiments. Materials were autoclaved as needed in order to avoid
          contamination and spread. Gloves and other equipment were properly
          disposed of into a designated trash bin for biological waste.
